# Laundry Availability

## Description
It can be frustrating having to walk over to do laundry (especially on cold/rainy days) and not find an available/working machine. This app aims to address this issue by reporting availability, thus, helping students plan when/where to do their laundry. Moreover, Facilites may benefit as they could re-arrange the locations/amount of machines based on usage and more quickly repair machines that are reported as broken.
