## Description
It can be frustrating having to walk over to do laundry (especially on cold/rainy days) and not find an available/working machine. This app aims to address this issue by reporting availability, thus, helping students plan when/where to do their laundry. Moreover, Facilites may benefit as they could re-arrange the locations/amount of machines based on usage and more quickly repair machines that are reported as broken.

* **Usage Insights**: Popular times tracking helps students plan out their laundry days to better fit their schedules. Facilities can analyze usage patterns to optimize machine placement and improve maintenance schedules.

## Possible Improvements

## Notes
> The deployed version uses synthetic data for popular times and demo purposes. Once there are enough users, this data will be removed and popular times will accurately reflect student usage.
