# Laundry Availability

## Description

It can be frustrating having to walk over to do laundry (especially on cold/rainy days) and not finding an available/working machine. This app aims to address this issue by reporting availability, thus, helping students plan when/where to do their laundry. Moreover, Facilites may benefit as they could re-arrange the locations/amount of machines based on their usage and more quickly repair machines that are reported as broken.

This project skeleton has been setup similar to our assignments and practicals. It is a Next.JS application, created with create-next-app `ðŸ’» npx create-next-app@latest`, which uses Jest and Testing Library for testing, ESLint for static analysis, Prettier for styling, and is configured to use GitHub actions for testing pull requests.

```
ðŸ’» npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom husky lint-staged prettier eslint-config-prettier @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom cross-env
ðŸ’» npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb

### Additional tools you might need

#### Mocking fetch

Tools for mocking fetch can be installed with

```

```

Note we need to pin the `node-fetch` version due to breaking changes when used with Jest in newer versions.
